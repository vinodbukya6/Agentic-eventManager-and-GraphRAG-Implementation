However, the scalability of Graph RAG is limited due to its reliance on graph structures, especially with extensive data sources. High-quality graph data is essential for meaningful outputs, and the system's ability to handle structured and unstructured data through graph-based hierarchies is a key feature. Overall, Graph RAG extends traditional RAG systems and enables richer and more accurate generative outputs for tasks requiring relational understanding.",
